# HTML Project: Exercise 1 and Exercise 2

## Introduction

This repository contains two HTML projects that showcase basic web development techniques. The projects demonstrate how to structure an HTML document, use CSS for styling, and implement responsive layouts. Both projects are simple examples designed to display content, such as personal profiles and webpages with navigation, images, and layout formatting.

### Exercise 1: Personal Profile Page
This project showcases a simple profile page for a fictional football player, Leonel Messi. It highlights some of his personal information, hobbies, and photos.

### Exercise 2: Figma Layout Design
This project replicates a layout inspired by the Figma website. It demonstrates a simple navigation header, introductory section, and multiple feature sections with images and text.
